# All-Projects-2021-to-2025
This is a repository of all the code and projects I've worked on during my time at both Iowa State University and St. Cloud State University. This repository isnt meant for editing or anything, its just a way to have all my school projects and practice code in one place for anyone to view. Since the submodules are clones of the original repos, they wont be as up-to-date as the others but I will try to keep them updated as much as possible. Again I want to emphasize that this is FOR VIEWING ONLY and ALL PULL REQUESTS MADE THROUGH THE SUBMODULES WILL BE DENIED, if you really want to sumbit one (idk why you would) do it throught the original repositories, Thank you! :)
